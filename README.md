# CPSC 304 Project Breakdown #

## Project Description ##
We plan to model a database and a GUI for a version control system like Github. Users will be able to add, delete and edit files and folders, and commit those actions to a repository on any branch they would like, as well as the ability to revert those changes if necessary.
