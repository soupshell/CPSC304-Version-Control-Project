## Project Description ##
We plan to model a database and a GUI for a version control system like Github. Users will be able to add, delete and edit files and folders, and commit those actions to a repository on any branch they would like, as well as the ability to revert those changes if necessary.

#### Description of challenges/things left to do ####
*  In case we are not done setting up database server on July 25: 
We will talk to TA on July 26 to ask for help, and then spend time after call setting it up.

* In case we are not done with React components by July 29, we can squeeze the SQL script creation timeline. We think that we can do all SQL script writing in one day- July 31st.
